# Analysis pipeline

We use a series of Python scripts to analyze the experimental findings of our cultivation studies and to estimate fermentation product fluxes based on this data, different dietary data, and key intestinal characteristics. The analysis is divided into different major steps as described here. We recommend to run the scripts in sequential order. 

- Step 1 - Analysis of experimental data.ipynb:- Step 2 - Plot experimental results  (Fig. 1).ipynb- Step 2a - distribution_abundance_coverage.ipynb- Step 2b - Plot different media.ipynb- Step 2c - Supplementary Cultivationmethod.ipynb- Step 2d - strain tree.ipynb- Step 2e - Plot pH variation.ipynb- Step 3 - Calculations reference diet (Figure 2).ipynb- Step 3a - Basic characteristics British diet.ipynb- Step 3b - Fecal weight.ipynb- Step 4a - Variation with microbiome - analyze variation.ipynb- Step 4b - Variation with microbiome (Figure 3).ipynb- Step 4c - Variation with microbiome - bioinformatics pathway analysis.ipynb- Step 5 - Variation with diet - Figures 4 and 6.ipynb- Step 5b - mouse data.ipynb

Further details and comments on the done steps are provided in the corresponding Jupyter scripts.
