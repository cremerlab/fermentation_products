<h2>Abstract</h2>
Fermentation products released by the gut microbiota provide energy and regulatory functions to the host. Yet, little is known about the magnitude of this metabolic flux and its quantitative dependence on diet and microbiome composition. Here, we establish orthogonal approaches to consistently quantify this flux, integrating data on bacterial metabolism, digestive physiology, and metagenomics. From the nutrients fueling microbiota growth, most carbon ends up in fermentation products and is absorbed by the host. This harvest varies strongly with the amount of complex dietary carbohydrates and is largely independent of bacterial mucin and protein utilization. It covers 2-5% of human energy demand for western, and up to 10% for non-western diets. Microbiota composition has little impact on the total harvest but determines the amount of specific fermentation products. This consistent quantification of metabolic fluxes by our analysis framework is crucial to elucidate the gut microbiotaâ€™s mechanistic functions in health and disease.



<h2>Interactive Fermentation Product Secretion Explorer</h2>

This interactive figure shows the distribution of estimated fermentation product secretion based on our framework and published human microbiome data. The top panel lets you choose different studies and filter individuals by age and health status. The grey histogram on the right indicates what fraction of total microbial biomass is covered by the bacterial species examined in this study.


The middle panel lets you either 
i) directly adjust how much microbiota available carbohydrate reaches the lower intestine,
ii) directly adjust how much starch and fiber are consumed, or iii) select different 
reference diets as described in the main text of the paper. 

The bottom panel displays the distributions of expected microbial biomass and 
fermentation products. Additionally, we show the total daily energy content of all 
secreted fermentation products.
