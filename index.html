<h2>Abstract</h2>
Fermentation products released by the gut microbiota provide energy and regulatory functions to the host. Yet, little is known about the magnitude of this metabolic flux and its quantitative dependence on diet and microbiome composition. Here, we establish orthogonal approaches to consistently quantify this flux, integrating data on bacterial metabolism, digestive physiology, and metagenomics. From the nutrients fueling microbiota growth, most carbon ends up in fermentation products and is absorbed by the host. This harvest varies strongly with the amount of complex dietary carbohydrates and is largely independent of bacterial mucin and protein utilization. It covers 2-5% of human energy demand for western, and up to 10% for non-western diets. Microbiota composition has little impact on the total harvest but determines the amount of specific fermentation products. This consistent quantification of metabolic fluxes by our analysis framework is crucial to elucidate the gut microbiotaâ€™s mechanistic functions in health and disease.

<h2>Interactive Fermentation Product Secretion Explorer</h2>

This figure permits an exploration of the distribution of our estimated fermentation product 
secretion from published studies of human microbiome composition. The top panel allows 
you to select between different published studies and filter on individuals within 
different age categories and health status. The grey histogram (right) illustrates
what fraction of the total microbial biomass is represented by the bacterial species 
we experimentally examined in this study.


The middle panel allows you to either 
i) directly adjust how much microbiota available carbohydrate reaches the lower intestine,
ii) directly adjust how much starch and fibers are consumed, or iii) select different 
reference diets as described in the main text of the paper. 


The bottom panel shows the distributions of expected microbial biomass and 
fermentation products. Additionally, we show the total daily energy content of all 
secreted fermentation products.
