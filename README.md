# `fermentation_products`
This repository houses all data and code (analysis and illustration) used in our study "Quantifying the daily fermentation product harvest from the human gut microbiota".

## Directory Structure
This repository is broken down into three major folders with their content described in the following.

### `analysis`
This directory contains all the Python code used to analyze and illustrate variations in fermentation product excretion and harvest.

### `hplc_measurements`
This directory contains the experimental data of our hplc measurements. Analysis code to extract from measurements growth rates and carbohydrate uptake and excretion rates are also included here. 

### `interactives`
This directory contains all the Python and JavaScript code needed to generate the interactive figures 
in this work.
