# Interactive figure

This folder contains the script to generate the interactive figure.  The code is based on a JavaScript to generate the interactive elements while reading in the results from our analysis file for each included metagenomic sample (result from our analysis pipeline). Central output is the html file interactive_excretion.html in the output folder. 

This file can be directly opened in a browser. Via our GitHub repository, we also made it available via https://cremerlab.github.io/fermentation_products/
